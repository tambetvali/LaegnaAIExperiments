# Drafts — README  
### A Workspace for Early Concepts, Partial Designs, and Evolving Ideas

The **Drafts** folder is the “workbench” of the LaegnaAIExperiments repository.  
Where **RandomThings** is a free‑form sandbox, **Drafts** is a more structured staging area:  
a place for ideas that are *not yet finalized*, but already have enough shape to be developed, refined, or promoted into the main toolset.

Drafts are the **half‑built bridges** between raw experimentation and polished components.

# 1. Purpose of This Folder

The Drafts folder exists to hold:

- Early versions of tools  
- Partial specifications  
- Architectural sketches  
- Notes that are too detailed for RandomThings  
- Experiments that are becoming coherent  
- Designs that need refinement before moving to NutsAndBolts  
- Concepts that may evolve into full subsystems  

It is the **pre‑production zone** of the repository.

If RandomThings is the “idea seedbed,”  
Drafts is the “prototype workshop.”

# 2. How Drafts Fits Into the Ecosystem

The LaegnaAIExperiments repository is an appendix to the broader Laegna ecosystem.  
Drafts plays a key role by:

- Capturing ideas that are *almost ready*  
- Allowing iterative refinement  
- Providing a space for architectural thinking  
- Acting as a buffer between experimentation and implementation  

Drafts often contain:

- Early versions of virtual filesystem concepts  
- Notes on indexing strategies  
- Markdown processing experiments  
- Tool‑use patterns  
- Training card formats  
- RAG indexing prototypes  
- Minimalist server or client logic  
- Ideas for future NutsAndBolts utilities  

Many of the tools in other folders **started here**.

# 3. What You Might Find Here

Drafts may include:

- Markdown documents describing tool ideas  
- Pseudo‑code for future utilities  
- Early versions of file‑processing logic  
- Notes on how to integrate Mistune or Pygments  
- Concepts for WYSIWYG editors  
- Experiments with file indexing or metadata  
- Sketches of training pipelines  
- Early RAG designs  
- Notes on caching, virtual filesystems, or tool orchestration  
- Partial implementations waiting to be refined  

These drafts are not polished, but they are **directional**.

They show where the ecosystem is heading.

# 4. How to Use This Folder

You can use Drafts to:

- Develop early versions of tools  
- Write down structured ideas  
- Test architectural patterns  
- Prepare concepts before moving them to NutsAndBolts  
- Explore how different components might interact  
- Document workflows or toolchains  
- Capture insights that need refinement  

Drafts are meant to be:

- Editable  
- Expandable  
- Replaceable  
- Iterative  

Nothing here is final — everything is allowed to evolve.

# 5. Relationship to Other Folders

Drafts sits between:

### **RandomThings**  
Raw, chaotic, exploratory ideas.

### **NutsAndBolts**  
Practical, implementable tools and patterns.

Drafts is the **middle layer**:

- More structured than RandomThings  
- Less finalized than NutsAndBolts  
- A place where ideas gain shape  
- A staging area for future components  

Drafts often feed into:

- ClientSideMistune  
- ClientSidePygments  
- MarkdownWYSIWYG  
- NutsAndBolts  
- Training‑related folders  

It is the **incubation chamber** for future tools.

# 6. Philosophy Behind This Folder

Drafts embodies the Laegna philosophy:

- Start small  
- Iterate  
- Keep things simple  
- Build only what is needed  
- Allow ideas to grow naturally  
- Avoid premature optimization  
- Encourage experimentation  
- Document thinking as it evolves  

Drafts preserve the **thinking process**, not just the final result.

---

# 7. Final Thoughts

The Drafts folder is:

- A structured workspace  
- A place for evolving ideas  
- A bridge between experimentation and implementation  
- A repository of partial designs  
- A staging area for future tools  

Use it to:

- Capture ideas before they disappear  
- Develop prototypes  
- Refine concepts  
- Prepare tools for the main ecosystem  

Drafts are not meant to be perfect —  
they are meant to **become** something.
