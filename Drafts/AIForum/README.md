# Update method:

1. Initially, I do some experiments in files whose names are prefixed with e1, e2 etc.:
- Each file has chapters, which starts with tasks to copilot.
- We ask to write code, but in form of manual, which contains essential, simplistic code yet opening up our architecture.
- We are not going to test whether we can run the code: this is API check we are going to test, whether we have compatible API within given design.
- The resulting documentation - indeed we can execute some, but it's not very important - can be fed back to copilot, giving it the link "https://github.com/tambetvali/LaegnaAIExperiments/new/main/Drafts/AIForum" as our design essentials. Based on the url it will use compatible libraries and services to fully implement the application.
