# General Reading Manual

## 1. Reading technical documents

When we read technical material, we don’t *immerse* ourselves in every sentence — we *use* it. Technical reading is functional rather than emotional.

- We depend on **formatting** and **syntax highlighting**; code is a formal language, and Markdown, code blocks, notebooks, or formatted docstrings help structure it.
- **Syntax highlighting** ensures we see *all information*, not a lossy or ambiguous representation.
- **Formatting** guides meaning:
  - **Bold** introduces concepts.
  - *Italic* reintroduces concepts, refers to standard thinking, or frames new conceptual structures.
- **Scanning** is the primary mode: icons, highlighted blocks, blockquotes, titles, and aligned layout help us navigate quickly.
- **Introductions and conclusions** are functional: they reveal the whole topic upfront and reduce the need for deep reading.
- We emphasize important information; mathematics and code are often less emphasized because experienced readers absorb them intuitively.
- Users follow their own interests and skip the rest.

## 2. Reading books

Books — especially large or reference‑style ones — are approached differently:

- We focus on **specific chapters** or **specific conceptions**, not the entire book.
- When reading many books on similar topics, we look for **the major points each one contributes**, since many chapters repeat across authors.
- We study the **structure** of a book first: its chapters, internal logic, and layout.
- Specialization is normal: some readers master only certain sections, while others spend weeks on a single page of formulas. Linear reading works only for certain people and situations.

## 3. Reading tutorials

Tutorial reading is pragmatic:

- We focus on **commands, tools, interfaces, and lists of considerations**.
- Sometimes we study code deeply, but often we simply **copy commands** after understanding the tool’s purpose.
- We skim headers, APIs, and highlighted sections, even if we don’t fully understand every optimization or trick.

## 4. A note on fiction

These principles apply to technical documents, documentation, and instructional material — not to fiction.

Fiction, poetry, and narrative writing are read differently:

- We let emotion build word by word.
- We avoid spoilers and do not seek the ending in advance.
- We read for the *experience*, not the structure.
- It’s closer to watching a film than using a tool.

# 1. Studying Technical Material: A Psychological and Practical Introduction

Technical material is not meant to be “read” in the literary sense. It is meant to be *studied*, *used*, *navigated*, and *applied*. The psychology of studying is fundamentally different from the psychology of reading stories. When we study, we optimize for clarity, structure, and selective focus; when we read fiction, we optimize for immersion, emotion, and narrative flow.

Studying requires a different mindset: we build a mental map of concepts, tools, and structures, and we move through that map according to our goals. We do not follow the text linearly; we follow our *intent*.

Below is a deeper exploration of how this works.

# 2. How We Study Technical Documents

## 2.1. We “use” technical text, not “read” it
Technical documents are functional objects. We do not dive into every sentence; we extract what we need. We rely on formatting, structure, and syntax highlighting to guide our attention. The goal is not emotional immersion but *efficient navigation*.

- **Formatting** introduces and reintroduces concepts.  
  - **Bold** marks new concepts.  
  - *Italic* marks conceptual references, abstractions, or mental models.  
- **Syntax highlighting** ensures we see *all information*, not a lossy or ambiguous representation.
- **Scanning** is the default mode: icons, headers, blockquotes, and aligned layout help us move quickly.
- **Introductions** reveal the whole topic upfront; they reduce the need for deep reading.
- **Conclusions** summarize the actionable parts; they help us decide what to do next.
- **Selective emphasis** lets us skip math or code until needed; experienced readers absorb these parts intuitively.

Technical reading is a *tool‑use activity*, not a narrative experience.

## 2.2. Working with large materials (example: d2l.ai)
Books like **Dive into Deep Learning (d2l.ai)** are massive: code, math, diagrams, discussions, multiple languages, multiple frameworks. It is not useful to “study the whole book.” Instead:

- We **choose areas of interest** (e.g., NLP, optimization, transformers).
- We **scan the structure** to know where important parts live.
- We **return later** when a specific problem requires deeper understanding.
- We **ignore entire sections** that are irrelevant to our goals.

This is not laziness; it is *optimization*. No one needs to master every framework or every mathematical derivation. We study what aligns with our path.

## 2.3. Human‑readable, code‑specific, and math‑specific references
Technical materials often divide into:

- **General human‑language explanations**  
- **Code‑language implementations**  
- **Math‑language derivations or proofs**

Each serves a different cognitive function:

- Human language builds intuition.  
- Code language builds operational understanding.  
- Math language builds formal guarantees.

We do not need to master all three at once. We move between them depending on our goals.

## 2.4. Studying frameworks, not memorizing content
AI materials often follow standard organizational patterns:

- “GPT‑like” models  
- Reinforcement learning  
- Machine learning vs. deep learning  
- Vision, NLP, audio, multimodal  
- Training, inference, optimization  

We study the *framework* — how information is structured — not every detail. Once we understand the map, we can navigate to any part when needed.

# 3. How We Study Books (Not Read Them)

## 3.1. Books as structured environments
Books, especially technical ones, are not linear experiences. They are *structured environments*:

- We explore chapters based on interest.
- We revisit sections when needed.
- We skip parts that do not apply to our goals.
- We build a mental model of the book’s architecture.

This is especially true for dictionary‑scale books or encyclopedic materials.

## 3.2. Specialization and depth
Some readers spend weeks on a single page of formulas. Others skim the math and focus on code. Both are valid.

Studying is not about covering everything; it is about:

- finding your **specialist area**,  
- understanding the **interfaces** between specialties,  
- and navigating the **shared conceptual space**.

For example:

- A specialist in *Natural Language Processing* may skim reinforcement learning.  
- A specialist in *tool‑building* may skim theoretical proofs.  
- A specialist in *mathematical optimization* may skim UI or WYSIWYG design.

Each specialist orients themselves relative to others, forming a shared ecosystem of knowledge.

## 3.3. Books as tools, not timelines
Technical books should be treated as *tools*, not linear narratives. Icons, formatting, diagrams, and code blocks turn them into interactive environments. We move through them like software, not like novels.

# 4. How We Study Tutorials

## 4.1. Tutorials are command‑driven
Tutorials are practical:

- We focus on commands, tools, interfaces, and lists of considerations.
- We often copy commands without reading every detail.
- We skim headers and APIs.
- We understand the tool’s purpose before its internals.

This is efficient and normal.

## 4.2. Tutorials as layered experiences
We can study tutorials at multiple levels:

- **Beginner:** copy commands, follow steps.  
- **Intermediate:** understand the structure and modify examples.  
- **Advanced:** rewrite or extend the system.  
- **Expert:** build new tools from the conceptual framework.

The same material supports all levels.

# 5. How This Differs from Fiction and Narrative Stories

Fiction is emotional, temporal, and immersive:

- We read every word.  
- We avoid spoilers.  
- We follow the timeline.  
- We let emotion grow gradually.  
- We experience the story like a movie.

Technical text is the opposite:

- We skip freely.  
- We jump between sections.  
- We use formatting as navigation.  
- We extract information rather than absorb emotion.  
- We treat the text as a tool, not a world.

Both are valuable, but they serve different cognitive modes.

# 6. The Mental Model of Studying

Studying is about:

- building a **mental map**,  
- identifying **your specialist area**,  
- understanding **the interfaces** between specialties,  
- navigating **multiple formats** (human language, code, math),  
- and using materials at **different levels** depending on your goals.

This approach lets you:

- dig into the body of information,  
- find your path,  
- collaborate with other specialists,  
- and grow in the direction that matches your interests and abilities.

Studying is not about reading everything. It is about *finding the right things* and *using them well*.
