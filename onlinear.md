# Online development and tools

We linearize the process of changing computers, working on clouds and generally being a digital nomad in terms of all our small toy projects:
- In Notion.so, you are fully online with your readable documents; you can use notaku.so to prepare your documents to humans, MD/CSV export to manually feed it to AI or Notion.so API through automated AI and client access.
- In GitHub and GitLab, you have fully online versioned filesystem to build your code, documentation and other resources. You can use online VSCode to access, update or create your repositories.
- You can use Codeanywhere for full Python IDE online - a development platform.
