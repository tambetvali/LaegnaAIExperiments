# Professionals of coding in spain

In Spain, in circles I happen to be, there are rarely any programmers.

I am currently poor, whole time here, and there are several scientific measurements here:
- They measured my programming abilities scientifically: professional authoritative worker in hostel measured my abilities by such abilities in general population, and found them improbable, basically ruled out.
  - His measurement was accepted by professionals (social workers, because I am poor: initially it seemed no danger).
  - By science, low-income people are generally not programmers, and programming population percentage in local areas basically rules this out, giving significant scientific measurement.
- They also measured my motivation:
  - Motivationally, book-keeper and general manager of the organization carry authority, and this is general authority carried out by professionals (working people).
  - My enthusiasm does not let them execute that authority, also as I am interacting with young, decent people, I provide them with "dark aura", which is organizationally unacceptable.
  - Enthusiasm about programming and business is a general syndrome of such thinking that one knows how to program.
- Also, programmers should work on testing and other simple things to provide the general self-esteem in society.
  - As I made monetary program how to help out people here with support of AI and programming, the money was too big for non-working person, and such income is not investment they can do.
  - Money is generally evil and I appeared to speak like businessman about resource use and other things AI can do (there are 5 areas where it could benefit this organization): it's generally non-profit organization and not interested in cost-cutting.
    - AI is also bad for nature, and running it in small local box for cost-cutting is indeed an area the nature cannot tolerate.
  - Money is generally evil and people need to do simple work to back-up their expenses, instead of appearing like evil men such as Bill Gates in their language use.
    - I need to introduce them with girls, because I have chosen young girls with business background to discuss software projects, instead of the psychologist who want to discuss my bad motivation.
    - This is stupid argument that motivation is real-world thing, and my paper "motivation of this system", where I explained motivation of different sides, does not matter: rather, the good motivation is to agree that the psychologist (who cancelled the project) is not the class which is against such projects, in case he cancels this; and this is not class society - rather, it's the company rule that I don't talk with high-class girls here any more.
      - Good motivation is to support the authority of psychologist, bookkeeper and general manager, who want to decide engineering, profitability and related areas in democratic manner with high-reputation members, rather than trusting the IT manager with business background, because she is a beautiful girl and I am preferring beautiful girls: AI analysis of these areas is not ethical, because ethical systems of Artifical Intelligence are not developed out.
      - I need to be cured from enthusiastic expressions, and anxienty if my project is closed, and get into comfortable situation with psychologist to prove my social esteem.
- They also measured all the problems I solved through my eyes: they were surprisingly sensitive to understand the exact nature of the problems, and told this kind of anxiety is not part of positive psychology and definitely I need to treat it.
